       <div class="aboutText">
           <p>My enthusiasm for problem solving and my empathetic approach in life has led me to the world of user experience design.
            <br>My designs range from planning and synthesizing research efforts to design conceptualization, usability testing, ideation, wireframing and prototyping. I love that UX design allows me to apply skill such as curiosity, design thinking and creativity. What excites me is being able to execute a project from start to finish as a team player while creating user centered design solutions. 
            <br>Using my colourful work experience, I combine a people-first mentality in all of my designs.  I am searching for opportunities to demonstrate my passion for human centered design. I thrive in fast paced environments, where feedback and teamwork is encouraged.
            <br>Beside design, I love to explore new hiking trails, going for bike rides along the lake and listening to a well curated playlist.
